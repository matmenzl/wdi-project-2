# About
'Meet Your Street' is a Social Network for Neibhgourhoods in order to organize their daily and social life. Share a garden hose, a wicked mower or look for neighbours who could bring you some meds while you're sick in bed: post it on Meet Your Street and get things done within your neighbourhood.   

'Meet Your Street' was built as a second coding project during Web Development Immersive at General Assembly London.

### Problems
+ There are a lot of social networks and sharing-websites out there. But who wants to drive 100 miles to get a garden hose. You want to be able to share stuff within your neighbourhood. It's social and good for the environment. Apart from that: You get in contact with your neighbours.  
+ Neighbourhoods are getting more and more anonymous. On Meet Your Street you can find like-minded people, f.e. for a a barbacue or a run in the park.
+ Elderly people are dependent on help from other people. F.e. to get a ride to the doctor or get some groceries. On Meet Your Street, you can organize this easily. 

### Solution and how it works
+ 'Meet Your Street' gets neighbours together digitally. All Posts on 'Meet Your Street' are geo-tagged. Only Neighbours in a range of max 1 Mile can access your profile and your posts. 
+ 'Meet Your Street' is set-up as easy as possible. Mein Use-Cases are: 
++ Uploading Posts (Text, Image) in order to offer sth. or look for sth.
++ Comment on Posts in order to organize everything or exchange details via Email
++ Restrict access to posts and users based on your registration-info (Street, Post-Code, City)
++ Allow access to posts only for users in the same neighbourhood

### Optimizations
+ Add SMS-Verification
+ Add interactive Google Map to search within a neighbourhood
+ Define Neighbourhood not only on distance but on area or zip-code etc.
+ Display neighbourhood on Google Map

'Meet Your Street' is built with Ruby on Rails with some help from:

+ jQuery
+ SCSS
+ Font Awesome
+ Foundation
+ Animate CSS
